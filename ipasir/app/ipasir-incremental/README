This application allows to solve arbitrary sequences of formulas incrementally.  For a sequence of formulas, an input file for this application describes how to update a formula to its successor. The application then interprets these update instructions and translates them into IPASIR API calls. 

A detailed description of this approach, in particular the algorithm to generate update instructions based on a sequence of related formulas as well as the used format, is currently under review for SAT 2015. 

The files in folder 'input'  correspond to benchmark problems used for the last Hardware Model Checking Competition (HWMCC 2014). Competition benchmarks are given as And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs). By means of the BMC-based tool aigbmc, CNFs for checking AIGs can be generated incrementally. Each input file contains update instructions for the sequence of CNFs of one benchmark problem.

Further input files can be generated if needed.
