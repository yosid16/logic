== COMiniSatPS Incremental (version 2Sun) ==

COMiniSatPS variation modified for incremental SAT.  Notable changes to
the non-incremental base solver:

 - Supports incremental pre-processing (incremental variable elimination).
 - Uses unique strategies specifically targeted for incremental SAT.

The 2Sun version disables the no-restart phase (i.e, no phase switching).
The incremental variable elimination is performance only for large benchmark
instances.


== ipasir.h ==

The glue code assumes that `ipasir.h' exist in the IPASIR root directory,
as stated in `<IPASIR root>/app/README').


== System Description ==

A PDF description file will be submitted to the competition event separately.
